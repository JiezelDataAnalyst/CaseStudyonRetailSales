Welcome to my Retail Sales Case Study!
This project demonstrates my full data analytics workflow—from data cleaning and EDA in SQL, to customer segmentation using RFM analysis, and finally, building interactive Tableau dashboards for visual storytelling.

To explore this case study:
- Review the Data Analysis Plan – This outlines the project objectives, approach, and key questions answered.
- Explore the SQL folder – Contains queries for data cleaning, KPI calculations, and RFM segmentation with documentation.
- Check out the Dashboard folder – Includes the interactive Tableau dashboard file (.twbx) and images used for storytelling.
- Compare Raw vs Cleaned Datasets – See how missing values, formatting issues, and inconsistent data were handled.
- Review Report – Full case study (contains screenshots which illustrate partial query outputs and final visualizations for quick reference).
